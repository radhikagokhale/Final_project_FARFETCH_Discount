Introduction to the Project: Discount Predictor 

This project is based on the analysis of the discount applied to different items in an E-commerce platform. 

Discounts applied to several items impact the revenues of any company, the project aims to understand which are the main characteristics within the dataset impacting the item discount.

The main purpose after the data analysis is creating a model that predicts if an item will have a discount or not.

With regards to the process: through the Jupyter Notebook there are several instructions which include the process of data cleaning, data analysis and data modelling. 

Overall, it was discovered that merchandise label, price, brand and stock are features that are good predicting the discount on an item.

For the model construction and comprehension, there is the list of files uploaded:

 - current_farfetch_listings.csv.zip : dataset used for the model prediction
 
 - discount_dashboard.twbx : visual representation of the data analysis

- discount_presentation.pdf : final project presentation

- final_project.ipynb : jupyter notebook of the coding through the process, from the beginning of loading and cleaning the dataset, to building the function in order to receive inputs

- function.cpython-38.pyc : py.cache

- function.py : function created and saved in py

- model_dt.pkl : model used through pickle (on the creation of the function above function.py)

- scaler.pkl : scaler used through pickle (on the creation of the function above function.py)
